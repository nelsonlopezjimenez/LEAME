Ensembl Release 108 Databases.

THE ENSEMBL FTP SITE
====================

The latest data is always available via a directory prefixed "current_".
For example "current_fasta" will always point to the latest data files in FASTA format.

The FTP directory has the following basic structure, although not all information is available for each species.
